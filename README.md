# Flatiron_side_project
I'd like you all to start working on a side project that we can use to continue to learn and discuss OO. Please create a new github repo, complete the deliverables, message me when you're done and then add me as a collaborator. I will discuss it with you further in our 1 on 1 today, but for those of us who have already spoken, go ahead and start. Remember to use the assignment as way to identify which labs/lectures would be most helpful to review. There is no due time but obviously the quicker you get it to me, the quicker I can give feedback and next steps. Here are the deliverables:

Build a Recipe Class:
A recipe has a name
A recipe has a description
Recipe#name returns the name of the recipe
Recipe#description returns the description for the recipe
The name of the recipe cannot be changed
The description of the recipe can be updated
Recipe.all returns a list of all of the recipes that have been created

Build a Restaurant Class:
A restaurant has a name
A restaurant has a star_rating which is an integer
A restaurant can change its name and its star_rating
